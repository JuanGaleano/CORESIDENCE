## Short description of the project

<p align="justify"> CORESIDENCE project is ERC-funded research project aiming to determine the dimensions of variations in and the rise of intergenerational coresidence between
adult children and their parents around the world and investigate how these trends are related to demographic, social, economic, and cultural/attitudinal factors.
To achieve this goal, we (i) use recent big microdata, which describe family change for more than half a billion people representing more than 120 countries 
worldwide; (ii) harmonize existing longitudinal data to examine pathways to intergenerational coresidence in six countries representing different norms and forms 
of intergenerational coresidence (India, Japan, Mexico, Senegal, Spain and the Netherlands).</p>
